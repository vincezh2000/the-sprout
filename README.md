## Features

### Movie Module
- The movie section is divided into two parts: the top list block and the popular movie recommendation block. After clicking on each recommended movie entry, the movie poster, introduction, and reviews will be displayed. Users can also rate movies based on their preferences, which will be recorded in the software server's database.
### Reading Module
- The reading module is divided into three parts: literature, pop culture, and life. By clicking on each recommended book entry, the book cover, book information, and introduction will be displayed. Users can also rate books based on their preferences.
### Music Module
- The music module is divided into four parts: pop, classic, Japanese and Korean, and European and American. By clicking on each entry, music can be played. During music playback, pause and end playback can be selected. In addition, after clicking to exit playback, music can be played in the background.
### User Login and Registration
- We have implemented user login and registration functions by connecting to the server.
